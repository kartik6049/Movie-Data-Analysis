# Movie Data Analysis

## Overview
This project performs exploratory data analysis on a movie dataset using Python. The goal is to analyze movie ratings, audience votes, genres, and year-wise trends to understand patterns in movie performance.

## Dataset
The dataset includes details of more than 5,600 movies with the following attributes:
- Movie Name
- Release Year
- Duration
- Genre
- Rating
- Votes
- Director
- Lead Actors

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Analysis Performed
- Data inspection and validation (null values and duplicates)
- Distribution analysis of votes and ratings
- Relationship analysis between votes and ratings using regression plots
- Identification of top-rated and most-voted movies
- Year-wise analysis of highest-rated and highest-voted movies
- Data visualization using bar charts, scatter plots, and joint plots

## Key Insights
- Movies with higher votes generally tend to have higher ratings
- Some movies achieve high ratings despite having fewer votes
- Audience engagement has increased significantly in recent years
- Certain years show a noticeable rise in highly rated films

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how exploratory data analysis and visualization help uncover trends and insights in movie datasets, making data-driven understanding easier and more effective.
